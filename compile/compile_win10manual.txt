Compile on windows manually if code fails:

Have python 3 installed, pip install pygame and pysinstaller
copy main.spec into code folder
open terminal, go to code folder, execute: python -m PyInstaller main.spec 
output is in dist folder, copy launcher.bat inside too
zip code folder and launcher.bat into bookofthings_win10.zip
cleanup the rest, remove main.spec, build, pycache (and dist once done)
