Instructions

    It will only work if the project has a specific structure (e.g. like in projects bookofthings,bouldershower,billiardknight)

2.) If on windows, have also 7zip installed 

3.) edit script: the appnamepre is project specific

4.) edit main.spec (notably the data= that should be project specific)

5.) using terminal (or cmd in windows), go to within this folder

6.) launch script. If linux/mac: ./compile_linux and if windows: compile_win10
    follow prompt (answer Yes if needed)

7.) the code runs pyinstaller, then cleans up. 
     the output zip file is found along the main game folder
