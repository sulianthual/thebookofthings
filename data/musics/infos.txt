Note:

1) from the website these wav are in 32 bit pcm. They dont work with some pygame versions (e.g. 1.9.6)
for compatibility may convert them to wav 16 bit (in folder dats):
for i in *.wav; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -f wav dats/"${i%.*}.wav"; done
there is still inconsistencies where files play at different speeds depending on pygame version

2) the mp3 do not work with never pygame version 2.0.0 

3) safest for compatibility is to convert everything to .ogg (in folder dats):
for i in *.wav; do ffmpeg -i "$i" -f ogg dats/"${i%.*}.ogg"; done

4) compiling for windows, oggs are NOT READ (this is a pygame/pyinstaller problem)
   so we are reconverted all files to wav
