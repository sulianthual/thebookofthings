* Main Guidelines:


* Mottos:
Keep it simple or will never finish this game !!!:
No more advanced physics! Only simple goofy minigames
No more advanced drawings! Only simple and goofy.
No more advanced modular story! Only one linear story.
No more advanced gaming. All games easily won with very few controls.

* Game Progression:
- Chapter I, II: set hero, partner, home (story setting)
- Chapter III: villain captures partner (disruption)
               hero meets sidekick, starts quest (find password to open evil lair)
- Chapter IV, V, VI: parts of quests
                    retrieve 3 parts of password in 3 locations (north,west,south)
- Chapter VII: final fight against villain, rescue the princess


* General Story Arc:
Each day/chapter of the story follows somewhat an arc (even if varying in content):
arc:     wake up -> morning game -> travel1 -> midday quest -> travel -> afternoon fight (game) -> travel2 -> aftermath -> ending
phases:      *          morning             |                           afternoon               |        evening       *
tension level: 0           2           1         2                 1           3                 1            2          0
morning games: morning breakfast, fishing, hunting, drinking, picking up flowers (no consequences)
midday quest: elder on mountain, gather crew, find villain's weakness....
final fight: dodge bullets, stomp fight, cut rope stealthily, takedown henchmens....
aftermath games: eat diner, serenade/kiss...(happy ending or not)
travel1: home to evil lair, or other (pirate island, iceberg?? space station??,timemachine)
travel2: X go back home, or to some location for an ending
*** Add a quest (between morning game and afternoon fight)


* Drawings:
DO NOT propose shadows for drawings, it makes people lazy and skip drawing (defeating the purpose)
KEEP the premade stickmans (do NOT make player draw them):
     because the stickmans drawings need to be precise and have many variations (crouch, dodge, zapped, mechs...)


* Minigames:
DO NOT add complex minigames that require a physics engine (e.g. platformer, brawler...)
It is NOT worth it to do with pygame (too painful to build from ground up, prefer other softwares like godot)
Keep few controls and make all minigames easily won: this is a game for non-gamers too.

* Ideas (implement maybe later or never, not so important):

- make all games easier to win, with fewer controls

- tff file: this font cannot do interrogation marks.




*Content
- Chapter 2: is a bit long with lots of drawings. Add minigames:
             can be tennis (play pong) with partner

- Chapter 4: add zelda like minigame while in hero enters the woods (like in the lost woods of zelda oot)
            1.) do smallish scenes with trees, bushes, flowers
            2.) scenes exits are several doors, all lead back to beginning of scene except one (that has music)
            3.) add a weapon to hero (sword?), and battle 2 critters: draw a bat, and a rat (can be reused later on), or a snake
            or....
            4.) meet bunny at entrance, then have to chase it through the woods.
            5.) add minigame with 3 bushes (similar to 3 cups and a ball) quickly shuffled before must guess in which bunny is hidding.

- Chapter 4: to make the lying game slightly more engaging:
             put two platforms, one for True, one for False
             then have the hero physically move/jump on one platform to make his choice
             (or make them large switches to activate: wrong answer makes a snake fall that has to be killed)

- Chapter 4: add the stomping minigame with the bunny (just adapt it)
             could add doom-like scary game in the forest
             could add stomping minigame with bunny (bunny demultiplies, jumps on hero, hero jumps on all bunnies)
             could add stomping minigame combined with lying minigame: fight/avoid while using correct True/Wrong (e.g. go to either area).

- Chapter 5: Add a minigame: maybe falling boulders when climbing the peak
             could add stomping minigame combined with rockpaperscissors minigame: fight/avoid obstacles while using correct prompts
            could make climbing minigame longer
            should reuse the rps minigame later on (easy to adapt)

- Chapter 6: should cannon and parachute hero into island (from the boat)
             make minigame where has to aim the cannon (A,D), shoot (W)
            then open parachute at the right time (S). Should fall vertically to correct area (the island)
            should reuse the sneaking minigame later on (easy to adapt, e.g. in the villain's quarters)

- Chapter 6: running cow game: can instead do vertical (like google dinosaur game)

- Chapter 7: extend it reusing all games from previous chapter (e.g. sneak in villains room, etc...)
- Chapter 7: boss fight, add ligntningbolts that villain can throw horizontally

- Somewhere...: Add a game with parabolic shooting ?
             can be done easily with naval battle and a cannon
             (could have been arc and bow for hunting too)
             or can be arc+bow on beach: multiple skeleton running from right to left (very slowly)
-Somewhere: recycle the breakfast drinking minigame
            (change the animations)
            e.g. use it to cut a rope, when the hero sneaks in castle and unties partner
- Somewhere...: fps game with simple shooting + arrows to move
            should be fairly simple to code, just enemies/items with small animations
            and that are always facing the player (only scale and fliph them)

Somwhere:
  rewrite story parts  with twists:
    1) point of view changes (shortly tell story from villain, partner, bug point of view)
    2) cut the chronology (like Pulp fiction type), justified by the book jumping between pages
    3) Add better character customization (influences text only):
      name, gender, catchphrase, temper (choose one), favorite/hated item, etc..., specie...

- Somewhere:
- medieval setting with a fight for the partner=princess
- space setting (villain is the father?) (space element on everyone)
- the hero is an anti-hero. partner rescues the hero
- parodie (they are "playing" their adventure)
- the fish becomes a river spirit (is huge)
- they are all super-heroes
- the fabric of reality: break everything, swapping images randomly
- add a mirror in villain chapter? in his lair?

- Some minigame ideas:
Hunt = Arrow Parabolic Arc [A][D] then [W]
Flappy Bird [W]
Play Pong [W][S] (tennis with partner)
stomping game [A][D]+[W] (with bunny that multiplies, add several bunnies that stomp)
Mario level= move [A][D] and jump [W] (kind of already done)
avoid falling boulders=[A][D]
space invaders=[A][D]
Basketball=jump and shoot Holding [S] in moving hoop laterally
Bait=guide monster to trap [WASD]. It charges straigth
Shooter=Cannon on fast rotating wheel, shoot stuff with [W]
Indiana jones ball behind=[A][D] to avoid obstacles
breakout game (pad, ball and horizontal layers of bricks)
helicopters for hero/villain with flappy bird and shooting
writing game: type quickly text or answer to it. What is your favorite color? ...etc...
skiing game like classic game
