* Main Guidelines:


* Mottos:
Keep it simple or will never finish this game !!!:
No more advanced physics! Only simple goofy minigames
No more advanced drawings! Only simple and goofy.
No more advanced modular story! Only one linear story.


* Game Progression:
- Chapter I, II: set hero, partner, home (story setting)
- Chapter III: villain captures partner (disruption)
               hero meets sidekick, starts quest (find password to open evil lair)
- Chapter IV, V, VI: parts of quests
                    retrieve 3 parts of password in 3 locations (north,west,south)
- Chapter VII: final fight against villain, rescue the princess


* General Story Arc:
Each day/chapter of the story follows somewhat an arc (even if varying in content):
arc:     wake up -> morning game -> travel1 -> midday quest -> travel -> afternoon fight (game) -> travel2 -> aftermath -> ending
phases:      *          morning             |                           afternoon               |        evening       *
tension level: 0           2           1         2                 1           3                 1            2          0
morning games: morning breakfast, fishing, hunting, drinking, picking up flowers (no consequences)
midday quest: elder on mountain, gather crew, find villain's weakness....
final fight: dodge bullets, stomp fight, cut rope stealthily, takedown henchmens....
aftermath games: eat diner, serenade/kiss...(happy ending or not)
travel1: home to evil lair, or other (pirate island, iceberg?? space station??,timemachine)
travel2: X go back home, or to some location for an ending
*** Add a quest (between morning game and afternoon fight)


* Drawings:
DO NOT propose shadows for drawings, it makes people lazy and skip drawing (defeating the purpose)
KEEP the premade stickmans (do NOT make player draw them):
     because the stickmans drawings need to be precise and have many variations (crouch, dodge, zapped, mechs...)


* Minigames:
DO NOT add complex minigames that require a physics engine (e.g. platformer, brawler...)
It is NOT worth it to do with pygame (too painful to build from ground up)
It should be done in NEXT games with other softwares that do this more easily (godot,etc...)

- Added the option to browse pages with either Space/Enter and Tab, or with the Mouse [Next][Back]
  (options can be tested in page.py, obj_chapterpage by commenting either option1 or option2)
  (browsing with mouse requires a few adjustments of text, command instructions to be polished...)
  It is much easier to browse with the mouse, but slightly less engaging
  Using the keyboard feels more like browsing the pages of a book.

* Final changes that should probably be made:


- compile with pyinstaller: linux, windows, mac

* Other Ideas (maybe later or never, not so important):

- tff file: cannot do text for interrogation marks. correct the file ?

- sound and music: volume bar (in settings). Just add volume multiplicators

- do comprehensive cleanup of music and sounds.
   - Avoid file duplicates
   - look (briefly) at volume levels
   - during page transitions: sometimes nosound, sometimes there is (with soundnextpage), clean it up
   - animations properly finish(). they shut down all sounds. Do same for dispgroup that hold animations:
     call finish() for dispgroup that calls finish for animations (that calls finish() for sounds)

- draws objects fonctionality (for textbox, image,animation, or dispgroup):
  launches a timer that makes draw  draw.show=False after timer ends (timer is automatic from updates)
  1) use option vanish=amount (starts timer) at creation to start timer
  2) or invoke draw.vanish(amount) to (re)start timer
  3) can easily be reversed using draw.show=False
useful for:
* healthbars: when hit add a cross that disappears fast.
* to make some cool effects , like dust or else in minigames/story

- customize locations: give them names

- Add better character customization (influences text only):
  name, gender, catchphrase, temper (choose one), favorite/hated item, etc..., specie...

- make other games:
 cheap spinoffs of famous games, where
 we draw all game assets then play a dumbed down/funny version.
 we can even do the same for the game audio with a mic.
E.g: kind of doom, kind of zelda, kind of mario
BUT DO THIS WITH GODOT, pygame is not scalable for big projects!

- text: (main text and textbox, textinput, textchoice). Can add options:
  fillcolor (background) (already possible for textbox)
  bold (no real difference with current font)
  italic
  underline (only pygame 2.0)
  => need to find a way to insert in self.text=['this is ', ('it',(255,255,255))]

- difficulty levels: select at profile setup, and can change in settings...(not too important)

- storytelling:
  some events are repetitive (like going to bed etc)
  in some place, could rewrite the story slightly with twists:
    1) point of view changes (shortly tell story from villain, partner, bug point of view)
       have other characters make some minigames, e.g. the villain wakes up and hero is at this door, etc...
    2) cut the chronology (like Pulp fiction type), justified by the book jumping between pages


- Somewhere...: fps game with simple shooting + arrows to move
            should be fairly simple to code, just enemies/items with small animations
            and that are always facing the player (only scale and fliph them)

- Chapter 2: add a minigame to pickup flowers for the partner
             add a tennis game to play against the partner

- Chapter 4: add the stomping minigame with the bunny (just adapt it)
             could add doom-like scary game in the forest
             could add stomping minigame with bunny (bunny demultiplies, jumps on hero, hero jumps on all bunnies)
             could add stomping minigame combined with lying minigame: fight/avoid while using correct True/Wrong (e.g. go to either area).


- Chapter 5: Add a minigame: maybe falling boulders when climbing the peak
             could add stomping minigame combined with rockpaperscissors minigame: fight/avoid obstacles while using correct prompts
            could make climbing minigame longer
            should reuse the rps minigame later on (easy to adapt)

- Chapter 6: should cannon and parachute hero into island (from the boat)
             make minigame where has to aim the cannon (A,D), shoot (W)
            then open parachute at the right time (S). Should fall vertically to correct area (the island)
            should reuse the sneaking minigame later on (easy to adapt, e.g. in the villain's quarters)

- Chapter 6: running cow game: can instead do vertical (like google dinosaur game)

- Chapter 7: extend it reusing all games from previous chapter (e.g. sneak in villains room, etc...)

- Somewhere...: Add a game with parabolic shooting ?
             can be done easily with naval battle and a cannon
             (could have been arc and bow for hunting too)
             or can be arc+bow on beach: multiple skeleton running from right to left (very slowly)

-Somewhere: recycle the breakfast drinking minigame
            (change the animations)
            e.g. use it to cut a rope, when the hero sneaks in castle and unties partner

- Credits: Make a song about "lie, cheat and steal"
          Play it with everyone dancing, with a little ball like a karaoke
          Write some verses about the story that rhymes
          "Once upon a time there was a hero in his prime, "
          "He saved his partner in no time. "
          ....
          And the chorus is:
          LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          learn how to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          its great to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          so fun to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          when life pulls you down and you just feel like a clown
          you will come around if you LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          (you can replace learn how to=> you need to, and so on...)

- World Map: path should not be drawn except by player

- new game plus (more options in text, customize characters with hats/clothes...).


- allow player to choose text font at beginning

- allow player to use color on drawings???


- allow player to name more stuff: like locations (the evil lair, home, the highest peak, etc...)
- Make game website (thebookofthings.com). with game download etc...
- remove unlock system (?)
- in file progress, add part: this can tell which part of chapter is done,
  if exiting and wanting to go back
  - Main menu should be: "settings, drawings, chapters, continue"
- add place where all drawings can be redone (maybe free roaming once region is unlocked)
- add new game plus: replay the game, but a few options are unlocked
                    like making more complex drawings, adding hats/pets/clothes....
                    and other small customizations
                    as well as making some games slightly harder
- when moving on map, remove all text? It is more beautiful
- medieval setting with a fight for the partner=princess
- space setting (villain is the father?) (space element on everyone)
- the hero is an anti-hero. partner rescues the hero
- parodie (they are "playing" their adventure)
- the fish becomes a river spirit (is huge)
- they are all super-heroes
- the fabric of reality: break everything, swapping images randomly
- add flavors to characters:
   the hero was "always angry", "dumb as a rock", etc...
    then it may just affect the story text with options, but still add a lot of depth to the story
- Somewhere: add a mirror in villain chapter? in his lair?
            easy to make a character reflection in the mirror
            the villain and mirror can have conversations, and the mirror can be his sidekick (to be defeated)
- allow player to place items (e.g. place 3 trees near the hero house, etc...)

- Possible minigame additions:
Hunt = Arrow Parabolic Arc [A][D] then [W]
Flappy Bird [W]
Play Pong [W][S] (tennis with partner)
stomping game [A][D]+[W] (with bunny that multiplies, add several bunnies that stomp)
Mario level= move [A][D] and jump [W] (kind of already done)
avoid falling boulders=[A][D]
space invaders=[A][D]
Basketball=jump and shoot Holding [S] in moving hoop laterally
Bait=guide monster to trap [WASD]. It charges straigth
Shooter=Cannon on fast rotating wheel, shoot stuff with [W]
Indiana jones ball behind=[A][D] to avoid obstacles
breakout game (pad, ball and horizontal layers of bricks)
helicopters for hero/villain with flappy bird and shooting
writing game: type quickly text or answer to it. What is your favorite color? ...etc...
skiing game like classic game
