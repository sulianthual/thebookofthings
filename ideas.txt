Ideas for game:


###################
* Main Guidelines:
Keep it simple or will never finish this game !!!:
No more advanced physics! Only simple goofy minigames
No more advanced drawings! Only simple and goofy.
No more advanced modular story! Only one linear story.


###################
* Game Progression:
- Chapter I, II: set hero, partner, home (story setting)
- Chapter III: villain captures partner (disruption)
               hero meets sidekick, starts quest (find password to open evil lair)
- Chapter IV, V, VI: parts of quests
                    retrieve 3 parts of password in 3 locations (north,west,south)
- Chapter VII: final fight against villain, rescue the princess

###################
* General Story Arc:
Each day/chapter of the story follows somewhat an arc (even if varying in content):
arc:     wake up -> morning game -> travel1 -> midday quest -> travel -> afternoon fight (game) -> travel2 -> aftermath -> ending
phases:      *          morning             |                           afternoon               |        evening       *
tension level: 0           2           1         2                 1           3                 1            2          0
morning games: morning breakfast, fishing, hunting, drinking, picking up flowers (no consequences)
midday quest: elder on mountain, gather crew, find villain's weakness....
final fight: dodge bullets, stomp fight, cut rope stealthily, takedown henchmens....
aftermath games: eat diner, serenade/kiss...(happy ending or not)
travel1: home to evil lair, or other (pirate island, iceberg?? space station??,timemachine)
travel2: X go back home, or to some location for an ending
*** Add a quest (between morning game and afternoon fight)


##################
* Some Additions to Make (maybe later):

- Chapter 1: draw the stickman (only give the shape of the head). Do positions:
    Standing (legs straigth, facing right)
    Walking (legs open)
    Crouching
    Jumping
    => Then have all movements needed with WASD.
    => use the stickman base for all drawings
- Motivate it with platform minigame

- Chapter 1: Add a TV and antenna (draw)
   Add minigame of jumping: first over bushes, then over house to fix the antenna
   put TV animation where something plays inside.
   Hero has basic life: sleeping, fishing, eating, and watching TV.
   => but this requires moving the house (and maybe pond+bush) to the first chapter.

- Chapter 2: add a minigame to pickup flowers for the partner
             add a tennis game to play against the partner
             make the garden the spot where could replay all minigames

- Chapter 2: The music key should not be drawn, except by player.

- Chapter 3: misses at least one drawing (?)
             could ask to draw the lightning bolt here maybe
             castle entrance would be spot to replay all minigames

- Chapter 4: the lying minigame should be a WORLD, not a series of PAGES
            this makes use of the datamanager.temp whish is messy
            (for example, we cant skip to middle of game because it skips initialization)

- Chapter 4: add the stomping minigame with the bunny (just adapt it)
              the bunny jumps over the hero
              start with one bunny, then up to 3 (the bunny multiplies)


- Chapter 5: Add a minigame: maybe falling boulders when climbing the peak
             or freezing temperatures (draw a snowman!)

- Chapter 5: make climbing into 3 minigames (childs)

- Chapter 6: should cannon and parachute hero into island (from the boat)
             make minigame where has to aim the cannon (A,D), shoot (W)
            then open parachute at the right time (S). Should fall vertically to correct area (the island)

- Chapter 6: running cow game: can instead do vertical (like google dinosaur game)

- Somewhere...: Add a game with parabolic shooting ?
             can be done easily with naval battle and a cannon
             (could have been arc and bow for hunting too)
             or can be arc+bow on beach: multiple skeleton running from right to left (very slowly)

-Somewhere: recycle the breakfast drinking minigame
            (change the animations)
            use it to cut a rope, or else stealthily

- World Map: path should not be drawn except by player

- Credits: Make a song about "lie, cheat and steal"
          Play it with everyone dancing, with a little ball like a karaoke
          Write some verses about the story that rhymes
          "Once upon a time there was a hero in his prime, "
          "He saved his partner in no time. "
          ....
          And the chorus is:
          LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          learn how to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          its great to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          so fun to LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          when life pulls you down and you just feel like a clown
          you will come around if you LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!
          (you can replace learn how to=> you need to, and so on...)



##################
* Other possible additions:

- Cleanup drawings (should be EXTREMELY minimal). Remove for example:
        music key chapter 2
        map paths
        floor on dodge bullets (has grass marks)
        grass marks for stomp game too
        chapter 3 electric shock on hero
        alarm clock -> must be white
        chapter 5 mountain peak with snow


- allow player to name more stuff: like locations (the evil lair, home, the highest peak, etc...)
- Make game website (thebookofthings.com). with game download etc...
- remove unlock system (?)
- in file progress, add part: this can tell which part of chapter is done,
  if exiting and wanting to go back
  - Main menu should be: "settings, drawings, chapters, continue"
- add place where all drawings can be redone (maybe free roaming once region is unlocked)
- add new game plus: replay the game, but a few options are unlocked
                    like making more complex drawings, adding hats/pets/clothes....
                    and other small customizations
                    as well as making some games slightly harder
- when moving on map, remove all text? It is more beautiful
- medieval setting with a fight for the partner=princess
- space setting (villain is the father?) (space element on everyone)
- the hero is an anti-hero. partner rescues the hero
- parodie (they are "playing" their adventure)
- the fish becomes a river spirit (is huge)
- they are all super-heroes
- the fabric of reality: break everything, swapping images randomly
- add flavors to characters:
   the hero was "always angry", "dumb as a rock", etc...
    then it may just affect the story text with options, but still add a lot of depth to the story
- Somewhere: add a mirror in villain chapter? in his lair?
            easy to make a character reflection in the mirror
            the villain and mirror can have conversations, and the mirror can be his sidekick (to be defeated)
- allow player to place items (e.g. place 3 trees near the hero house, etc...)
