* Game Progression:
- Chapter I, II: set hero, partner, home (story setting)
- Chapter III: villain captures partner (disruption)
               hero meets sidekick, starts quest (find password to open evil lair)
- Chapter IV, V, VI: parts of quests
                    retrieve 3 parts of password in 3 locations (north,west,south)
- Chapter VII: final fight against villain, rescue the princess
Each day/chapter of the story follows follows a similar arc:
arc:     wake up -> morning games -> travel -> quest  -> travel -> evening games -> go to sleep


* Drawings:
The drawings are kept simple (not shadows as it makes them lazy for drawing)
Some is premade (e.g. the stickman) or it would be too complex


* Minigames:
The minigames do not have complex physics or it would be too painful to build with pygame
Keep few controls and make all minigames easily won: this is a game for non-gamers too.

* Ideas (implement maybe later or never, not so important):




*Content

- Chapter 8: make a COMPETITIVE version of each minigame
             has a highscore that is saved and can be improved (e.g. number of bunny killed, time survived)
             difficulty start easy and increases on a timer (to a constant that is near impossible)
             serenade: notes scroll and must play like guitar hero
             shoot bunnies: survive as long as possible with increasing waves (bunnies can now hit from behind)
             cow ride: survive as long as possible (will go gradually faster)
             

- Chapter 5: after rock-paper-scissors, the elder escapes
             must do platform jumps in the sky (and clouds) to catch him (with a small hero/big head for better control)
             ends with boss fight (the elders head at top of screen) 
             with moving platforms, and waves of moving rock (vertical), scissors (horizontal), paper (diagonal)
             to win the hero must survive all waves (and go hit the elder at top of screen)
             

- Chapter 6: when meeting the sailor, must earn his trust by drinking together (reuse minigame draft)
             must drink some number of glasses than him (a lot), but wasted meter is shorter so will end drunk
             to win, must trow away own drink while sailor is not watching (else will drink triple)


- Somewhere...: Add a game with parabolic shooting ? left-right to aim then shoot
              e.g. naval battle with cannon against skeleton boat (turn by turn) when leaving skeleton island, 
              or arc and bow for hunting
             

- Somwhere:
  rewrite story parts  with twists:
    1) point of view changes (shortly tell story from villain, partner, bug point of view)
    2) cut the chronology (like Pulp fiction), justified by the book jumping between pages
    3) Add better character customization (influences text only):
      name, gender, catchphrase, temper (choose one), favorite/hated item, etc..., specie...

- Somewhere:
- an iceberg, space station, time machine
- medieval setting with a fight for the partner=princess
- space station, the moon (space helmet on everyone)
- a time machine (replay some former scenes)
- the hero is an anti-hero. partner rescues the hero
- parodie (they are "playing" their adventure)
- the fish becomes a river spirit (is huge)
- they are all super-heroes
- the fabric of reality: break everything, swapping images randomly
- add a mirror in villain chapter? in his lair?

- Some minigame ideas:
Hunt = Arrow Parabolic Arc [A][D] then [W]
Flappy Bird [W]
Play Pong [W][S] (tennis with partner)
stomping game [A][D]+[W] (with bunny that multiplies, add several bunnies that stomp)
Mario level= move [A][D] and jump [W] (kind of already done)
avoid falling boulders=[A][D]
space invaders=[A][D]
Basketball=jump and shoot Holding [S] in moving hoop laterally
Bait=guide monster to trap [WASD]. It charges straigth
Shooter=Cannon on fast rotating wheel, shoot stuff with [W]
Indiana jones ball behind=[A][D] to avoid obstacles
breakout game (pad, ball and horizontal layers of bricks)
helicopters for hero/villain with flappy bird and shooting
writing game: type quickly text or answer to it. What is your favorite color? ...etc...
skiing game like classic game


space invaders but from the right:
jump and throw stone horizontally to right.
3 bats (3 heights) coming from right very slowly, must stone all 3 before reach player
